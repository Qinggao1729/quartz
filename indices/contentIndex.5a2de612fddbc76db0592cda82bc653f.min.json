You can **hover over** a node to see the connections more clearly. Better in Obsidian!\n- **Links**: You can **hover over** a link to show the preview of it. Better in Obsidian!\n- **Backlinks**: Listing all the nodes that link to that node.\n- **Tags**: All tags can be founded [here](https://qinggao1729.github.io/quartz/tags/), but they are much more general than links.\n\n**You can start from [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]**.\n\n\n___\n# About Quartz\nHost your second brain and [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) for free. \n\n### Troubleshooting\n- 🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n- 👀 [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t)\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-06T02:12:13.349798452Z","tags":null}}

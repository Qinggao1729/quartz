Features
- **Graph**: showing how nodes are connected to each others. You can **hover over** a node to see the connections more clearly.
- **Links**: You can **hover over** a link to show the preview of it.
- **Backlinks**: Listing all the nodes that link to a node.
- **Search Bar**: You can also use the powerful search functionality to search for anything.
-   **Tags**: This is not very polished yet, but you can play around with different tags to explore different topics, e.g. [#Status/Good](https://notes.aadam.dev/tags/Status/Good/) and [#on/5G](https://notes.aadam.dev/tags/on/5G/).
    -   All the tags can be seen [here](https://notes.aadam.dev/tags/), but keep in mind that it’s not organized very well yet.

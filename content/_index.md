Zettelkasten for Berkeley Math53 Multivariable Calculus (mainly focus on chapter 16).

A better way to view it is through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

You can propose changes through [github](https://github.com/Qinggao1729/quartz) or [email](mailto:qinggao.hong@berkeley.edu).

Features
- **Search Bar**: Search for anything.
- **Node**: Each page/note is a node.
- **Graph**: showing how nodes are connected to each others. You can **hover over** a node to see the connections more clearly. Better in Obsidian!
- **Links**: You can **hover over** a link to show the preview of it. Better in Obsidian!
- **Backlinks**: Listing all the nodes that link to that node.
- **Tags**: All tags can be founded [here](https://qinggao1729.github.io/quartz/tags/), but they are much more general than links.

**You can start from [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]]**.

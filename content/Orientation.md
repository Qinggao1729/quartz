# Closed Curve in 2D

Counterclockwise as positive direction, clockwise as negative direction.

If $C$ is given by the vector function $\vec{r}(t), a\le t\le b$ then the region $D$ is always on the left as the point $\vec{r}(t)$ traverses $C$.

# Normal of Curve in 2D
If $\vec{r}(t)=(x(t), y(t))$, then

Unit normal vector is $\vec{n}(t)=(\frac{y^{\prime}(t)}{\left|\vec{r}^{\prime}(t)\right|} , -\frac{x^{\prime}(t)}{\left|\vec{r}^{\prime}(t)\right|} )$

(90Â° clockwise rotation)

# from 1D to 2D
Curve $C$ is given by $\vec{r}(t)=(x(t), y(t))$
Tagent vector $\vec{r}^{\prime}(t)=(x_{t}, y_{t})$
$\mathrm{d}C=\left|\vec{r}^{\prime}(t)\right|\mathrm{d}t=\sqrt{x_{t}^{2}+y_{t}^{2}}\mathrm{d}t$
[[Magic factor]]$=\left|\vec{r}^{\prime}(t)\right|$

Curve $C$ is given by $\vec{r}(t)=(x(t), y(t), z(t))$

Suppose $\vec{F}=(P,Q)$

Let $C$ be closed curve surrounding region $A$

Then
$$\oint_{C} \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{r}=\oint_{C} P \mathrm{d}  x+Q \mathrm{d}  y=\iint_{A}\left[\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right] \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{d} y$$
(see [[Vector line integral]])

Integral of $[\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y}]$ over a 2D region (or surface) living in 2D space = function $\vec{F}$ over a 1D boundary (or closed curve)

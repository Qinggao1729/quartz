Integral of [[Derivative]] over a region = difference of function over a boundary

Sum up the total weight or amount of a function described in input space.

# 1D Calculus
$f: R\to R$
$$\int_{a}^{b} \frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d} x} \mathrm{d}x=f(b)-f(a)$$
Integral of [[Derivative]] over a 1D object = difference of function at two 0D object

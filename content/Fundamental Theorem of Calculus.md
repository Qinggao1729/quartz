Integral of [[Derivative]] over a region = difference of function over a boundary

Sum up the total weight or amount of a function described in input space.

# 1D Calculus
$f: R\to R$
$$\int_{a}^{b} \frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d} x} \mathrm{d}x=f(b)-f(a)$$
Integral of [[Derivative]] over a 1D object living in 1D space = difference of function at two 0D object

# [[Vector Line Integral]] in Higher Dimensions
[[Mapping]]: $f:R^{n} \to R^{n}$

[[Gradient]]
$$\int_{C} \nabla f \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{r}=f[\vec{r}(t=b)]-f[\vec{r}(t=a)]$$
Integral of [[Derivative]] over a 1D object  living in nD space= difference of function at two 0D object

title: "Path-independent"
---
Idea: If the boundary in [[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]] is the same, then the integral of derivative over a region should be the same. Path-independent is this equivalance in the context of [[Vector line integral]]

A [[Vector field]] $\vec{F}$ is path-independent if the [[Vector line integral]]$\int_{C} \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{r}$ is the same no matter what path you take.
# $\oint_{C} \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{r}=0 \leftrightarrow \vec{F}$ is path-independent

For any closed curve $C$

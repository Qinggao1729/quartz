Idea: 

# Definition
A [[Vector field]] $\vec{F}$ is path-independent if the [[Vector line integral]]$\int_{C} \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{r}$ is the same no matter what path you take.
# Lemma
For any closed curve $C$

$\oint_{C} \vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d} \vec{r}=0 \leftrightarrow \vec{F}$ is path-independent
